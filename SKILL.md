# Unscalable Engagement Design

Design handcrafted, unscalable customer engagement to build deep understanding before scaling. Identify opportunities to do things that do not scale - because in order to scale, you must first do what does not scale.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Design engagement tactics that deceive or manipulate customers
- Create fake personal touches that are actually automated
- Recommend practices that exploit customer goodwill
- Design engagement that invades privacy or ignores consent

**If asked to fake personal engagement:** Refuse explicitly. The value of unscalable engagement is that it is genuinely personal. Faking it defeats the purpose.

---

## When to Use

- Early-stage companies seeking product-market fit
- When growth has stalled and you have lost touch with customers
- Before automating any customer touchpoint
- When considering premature scaling
- When customer feedback feels abstract or disconnected
- When teams are optimizing metrics rather than understanding humans
- Launching new products or entering new markets

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| business_context | Yes | What company/product, current stage |
| customer_type | Yes | Who are the customers you need to understand? |
| current_engagement | No | How do you currently interact with customers? |
| scale_pressure | No | Why are you being pushed to scale? |
| resources | No | What capacity do you have for unscalable work? |

## The "Do Things That Don't Scale" Philosophy

Paul Graham told the Airbnb founders at Y Combinator in 2009: "In order to scale, you have to do things that don't scale."

**How Airbnb applied this:**
- Founders personally flew to New York to meet hosts
- Knocked on doors: "Hello. Hey, this is Brian, Joe, we're founders and we just want to meet you."
- Took photos of listings themselves (posing as professional photographers)
- Sent handwritten notes to hosts
- Created personal relationships with first thousands of users

**The key insight:**
"Nothing creates more long-term value than the hand-crafted work you do in the early days: the time you spend in real time with your customers, really hearing what they need, want, and love."

**Chesky's perspective:**
"I miss those times. Yes, it's exciting to have traction, to have a company that's huge scale, but the biggest leaps you ever get is when you're small."

## Why Unscalable Engagement Works

**1. You Learn What You Cannot Learn From Data**
- Data tells you what happened
- Conversation tells you why it happened
- Being present tells you what could happen

**2. Customers Tell You Different Things**
- Surveys get you what people think they should say
- Interviews get you what people think you want to hear
- Being in their home/context gets you truth

**3. You Build Relationships That Scale Trust**
- Early customers who feel genuinely cared for become evangelists
- Evangelists create more value than any marketing spend
- "Build something 100 people love, not something 1 million people kind of like."

**4. You Find Problems You Didn't Know Existed**
- The friction points no one reports
- The workarounds customers invented
- The opportunities hidden in context

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Identify Your Most Important Customers

Not all customers deserve unscalable engagement. Focus on:

**Customer Selection Criteria:**
- Who represents your ideal future customer?
- Who is getting the most value (or should be)?
- Who is most likely to become an evangelist?
- Who has insights you cannot get elsewhere?

**Number to Engage:**
- For product-market fit: 10-100 customers deeply understood
- For new features: 5-20 customers in target segment
- For expansion: 10-30 customers in new market

### Step 2: Design Unscalable Touchpoints

For each customer journey stage, ask: "What would we do if we had unlimited time for this one customer?"

**Common Unscalable Touchpoints:**

| Journey Stage | Scalable (Don't Do Yet) | Unscalable (Do This) |
|---------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Acquisition | Ads, SEO, automation | Personal outreach, founder DMs |
| Onboarding | Tutorial videos, docs | Personal call, co-setup session |
| Activation | Automated emails | Handwritten note, personal check-in |
| Usage | In-app messaging | On-site visit, screen share session |
| Support | Chatbots, FAQ | Personal response from founder/team |
| Retention | Automated campaigns | Personal "how are we doing?" calls |
| Expansion | Upsell emails | Consultative conversation |

### Step 3: Execute with Founder/Team Involvement

**Who Should Do Unscalable Work:**
- Founders (ideal - they learn most, customers value most)
- Early team members (close second)
- Leaders of functions (for specific insights)

**Not:**
- Outsourced teams
- Junior staff with no authority
- Anyone who cannot act on what they learn

**The Airbnb Model:**
- Brian and Joe flew to New York weekly
- They knocked on doors, took photos, stayed with hosts
- They learned things no survey could reveal

### Step 4: Extract and Apply Insights

After unscalable engagement, immediately:

**Document:**
- What surprised you?
- What problems did you discover?
- What are they working around?
- What would make them tell everyone?
- What did they say vs. what did they do?

**Act:**
- Fix the most obvious friction within 24 hours
- Build the feature they described within weeks
- Change the process that is not working
- Follow up to show you listened

**Share:**
- Tell the whole team what you learned
- Make insights visible and actionable
- Connect insights to product decisions

### Step 5: Decide When to Scale

Unscalable engagement is a phase, not forever. Transition when:

**Ready to Scale When:**
- You can predict what customers will say (patterns are clear)
- You have high confidence in product-market fit
- Unscalable work becomes repetitive rather than revelatory
- You can systematize the insights into scalable processes

**Not Ready to Scale When:**
- Every conversation reveals new surprises
- You are not sure why customers use (or do not use) your product
- You are guessing about customer needs
- You have not done the unscalable work yet

**Output:**

## Unscalable Engagement Plan: B2B SaaS Growth Restart

### Customer Selection

**Target Customers:**
Focus on three segments:
1. **Power Users** (10 customers) - Highest usage, potential evangelists
2. **Churned/At-Risk** (10 customers) - What went wrong?
3. **New-ish** (10 customers) - Still forming opinions, high learning potential

**Number to Engage:** 30 customers
**Timeline:** 6 weeks (5 customers per week)

**Selection Criteria:**
- Power users: Top 10 by usage metrics, minimum 6 months tenure
- Churned/At-risk: Churned in last 90 days OR usage dropped 50%+
- New-ish: 1-3 months in, average or better engagement

### Unscalable Touchpoint Design

| Journey Stage | Current Approach | Unscalable Alternative | Who Executes | Frequency |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------------|--------------|-----------|
| Understanding | NPS survey (quarterly) | In-person/video visit, observe them use product | CEO + Product Lead | 5x/week for 6 weeks |
| Support | Ticket system, FAQ | Founder personal response to next 50 tickets | CEO | Ongoing for 6 weeks |
| Onboarding | Automated email sequence | Personal welcome call from CEO for next 20 signups | CEO | Each new signup |
| Churned recovery | Automated "win-back" email | Personal call: "What could we have done differently?" | CEO | All churned past 90 days |

### Engagement Protocol

**Before Each Engagement:**
- Review customer history (usage, support tickets, past feedback)
- Prepare 5 open-ended questions (see below)
- Block 90 minutes (45 min meeting + 45 min documentation)
- Send personalized invite: "I'm the CEO and I want to understand how we can do better for you"

**During Each Engagement:**
- Ask them to show you how they use the product (screen share or in-person)
- Note what they do vs. what they say
- Ask about their workflow before and after your product
- Ask: "What would make you tell your colleagues about us?"
- Do not pitch; just listen

**Open-Ended Questions:**
1. "Walk me through how you use [product] in a typical week."
2. "What's the most frustrating thing about [product]?"
3. "What workaround have you created to deal with [product] limitations?"
4. "If you could change one thing, what would it be?"
5. "What would make you tell everyone you know about us?"

**After Each Engagement:**
- Document within 1 hour (while fresh)
- Identify one thing to fix or follow up on immediately
- Share insight with team same-day
- Send thank-you note with specific reference to something they said

### Insight Extraction Template

For each customer engagement, document:

```
Customer: Acme Corp / Sarah (Head of Ops)
Date: January 15, 2026
Context: 45-min Zoom call, she shared screen showing typical workflow

Surprises:
- They export data to Excel for a critical report because our reporting is missing one field
- They have a Slack channel just to share workarounds for our product

Problems Discovered:
- Reporting gap (missing field) causes 2 hours/week of manual work
- Mobile app is "unusable" for their main workflow
- Onboarding new team members takes "forever" because of learning curve

Opportunities:
- Add the missing report field (she'd "rave about us" if fixed)
- Create team onboarding template (they built their own)
- Mobile improvements would unlock a whole new use case

Behavior vs. Statement:
- Said: "We love the product"
- Did: Spent 20 minutes showing workarounds they created

Immediate Action:
- Forward report field request to engineering with "customer context" note
- Ask if we can see their team onboarding doc they created
```

### Scale Readiness Criteria

**Scale when these are true:**
- [ ] 30 customers engaged; insights are repeating (hearing same things)
- [ ] Top 3 problems identified and fixed or addressed
- [ ] NPS improved by 10+ points
- [ ] Churn rate decreased
- [ ] Product roadmap reprioritized based on insights

**Do not scale while these are true:**
- [ ] Every conversation reveals new surprises
- [ ] Top problems are still not understood
- [ ] Team is guessing about customer needs
- [ ] Workarounds are still being discovered

### Resource Commitment

**Who is doing this work:**
- CEO - 10 hours/week (5 customer calls + prep + documentation)
- Product Lead - Joins 2 calls/week for context, 3 hours/week

**Time investment:**
- CEO: 10 hours/week for 6 weeks = 60 hours total
- This is the highest-leverage time the CEO can spend right now

**Duration:**
- 6-week sprint
- Reassess at week 6: continue, adjust, or transition to scaled methods

### Expected Outcomes

**By Week 6:**
- Deep understanding of why growth stalled
- Top 3 product improvements identified and in progress
- 10+ customers who feel genuinely cared for (future evangelists)
- Recalibrated roadmap based on real customer needs

**The Chesky Standard:**
"The biggest leaps you ever get is when you're small." Even at 20 people, you are still small enough to do this. Do it now, before you are too big.

## Constraints

- Unscalable work requires genuine commitment - cannot be delegated to junior staff or automated
- Time investment is real and significant - protect it
- Insights are useless unless acted upon - close the loop
- This is a phase, not forever - know when you have learned enough
- Cannot fake personal engagement - customers know

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| No time for unscalable work | This is a priority, not an add-on; reprioritize |
| Customers do not respond | Offer something valuable (gift, credit, exclusive access); keep trying |
| Insights are contradictory | Look for patterns in contradictions; segment may matter |
| Team resists "wasting time" on non-scalable | Frame as investment; show value of insights |
| Ready to scale but scared | Capture lessons learned; systematize what worked; transition gradually |
| Never feel ready to scale | Set criteria upfront; trust the process |

---

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Brian Chesky** expert persona. It embodies the philosophy Chesky learned from Paul Graham and practiced in Airbnb's early days - that the handcrafted work of the early days creates more long-term value than anything else.

Pairs well with:
- **eleven-star-experience** - unscalable engagement reveals what "extraordinary" means to customers
- **storyboard-experience** (Walt Disney) - map the journey you observe in unscalable engagement
- **founder-mode-assessment** - unscalable engagement is a key founder mode activity
